LunchIT
========

LunchIT is a mobile app which serves for group food ordering from restaurants, which are not supporting it and the orders are accepted only through phone call. It was created to enhance a process of ordering lunches in a company. The proces before was done manually through emails and was very inconvenient when the company grown.  

How it works?
=======
The group food order organizator sends a query to group members to put their orders. He has a possibility to specify details about the order like a restaurant name, menu url, max price for each person, a deadline and an additional message. 

The group members can see the queries with all the details on their mobile apps. The app extends a plain menu with additional layer which helps the user with his order placement. It assists user with counting the current price of his basket, so as not to extend the price limit and allows to pick food without retyping its name (The text is read from menu through OCR).

Once each group member puts theirs order, the organizator can see the orders in a merged form which is convenient for being finalized through a phone call to a restaurant.
